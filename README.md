## 📄 Overview
This repository contains the LaTeX source, figures, and reproducibility code for  
**“Physics-Anchored Symbolic Basins and Alignment Overlap Integrals for Cyber-Resilient Artificial Intelligence”**  
submitted to the *Journal of Intelligent Computing Systems (JICS)* 2025.

Symbolic Basins are introduced as a physics-inspired regularization mechanism that maps plasma confinement mathematics to latent-space dynamics in neural networks, enabling measurable mitigation of semantic drift (“AI hallucinations”) with minimal computational overhead.
